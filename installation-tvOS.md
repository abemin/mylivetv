# How to install MyLiveTV on AppleTV using Sideloadly

**Step 0.** 
If you do not have a Mac computer, you can use a MacOS virtual machine on your Windows, Linux, or other operating system. You can find some options for MacOS virtual machines online.

**Step 1.** 
Download Sideloadly on your Mac or Windows PC from the [official website here](https://sideloadly.io/).

**Step 2.** 
Now launch Sideloadly and click on the Cancel button when prompted Sideloadly cannot be opened.

**Step 3.** 
On macOS Ventura or later go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security and scroll down.

**Step 4.** 
Click on ‘Open Anyway’ where it says “Sideloadly” was blocked from use because…, then verify with Mac password and click on OK buttons on subsequent popups.

**Step 5.** 
- Download the MyLiveTV app IPA file from the official [Abemin GitHub page](https://github.com/abemin/mylivetv).

**Step 6.** 
- Connect your Apple TV to the same network as your Mac computer. 
- On your Apple TV, go to **Settings** > **Remotes & Devices** > **Remote App & Devices** and keep it on that screen so Sideloadly will detect your Apple TV.
- You only need to do this for the first time connection.
